500mL double cream
50g gorgonzola
3 tbsp freshly grated Parmesan cheese
3/4 tsp salt
3/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
3 tbsp minced fresh parsley

1) Bring the cream to a full boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat, then continue to boil rapidly for 45 to 50 minutes, until thickened like a white sauce, stirring occasionally.
2) Off the heat, add the Gorgonzola, Parmesan, salt, pepper and parsley. Whisk rapidly until the cheeses melt together. Serve the sauce warm.
3) If you must reheat, warm the sauce over low heat until melted, then whisk vigorously until the sauce comes together.
